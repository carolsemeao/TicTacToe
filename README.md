# TicTacToe
Hello and welcome to my Pok√©mon retro style Tic Tac Toe game.

Thanks to an in-depth tutorial on YouTube from Justin Kim.
Here's the link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rzhcb4M9-0Q
He explained everything very well and I learned a lot from him.
I did not copy and paste his source code. I typed in everything myself with his instructions and personalized it to my liking.

Hope you enjoy my game! :)
